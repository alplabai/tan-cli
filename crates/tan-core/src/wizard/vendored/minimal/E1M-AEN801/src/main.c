 * hello-world -- the canonical "first program" for the Alp SDK.
 *
 * No peripherals, no chips, no board-specific wiring.  Just the
 * boot path + a periodic printf loop so customers can confirm
 * their toolchain + flash flow + log console are wired correctly
 * before chasing harder bugs.
 *
 * What success looks like:
 *
 *   [hello] Alp SDK hello-world starting
 *   [hello] tick 0
 *   [hello] tick 1
 *   ...
 *   [hello] tick 4
 *   [hello] done
 *
 * Where the output lands depends on the SoM:
 *
 *   * E1M-AEN (Alif Ensemble) -- the SoC's first USART, surfaced
 *     on the EVK board as the FTDI USB-UART (open at 115200 8N1).
 *   * E1M-V2N / V2N-M1        -- the Renesas SCIF console; same FTDI
 *     bridge on the E1M-X-EVK at 115200 8N1.
 *   * native_sim host build   -- stdout of the host binary.
 *
 * The SDK doesn't ship its own alp_log API yet (planned post-1.0);
 * use printf or Zephyr's LOG_* macros directly.  This example uses
 * printf for clarity -- it lands on whatever Zephyr has picked as
 * its console (CONFIG_LOG_BACKEND_UART under the hood).
