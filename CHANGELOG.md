## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **The Renode smoke's CPU halted on an MRAM-linked image.** Renode guesses
  `VectorTableOffset` from the LOWEST `vaddr` it sees. A Zephyr image linked to
  MRAM has a `.data` init segment that RUNS at 0x20000000 but is STORED at
  0x80018348, so the guess pointed at memory nothing was loaded to: SP/PC read
  back as zero and the CPU halted before executing one instruction, while the
  run still exited 0. `tan renode` now derives the real vector-table base from
  the ELF — the load address of the LOAD segment containing the entry point —
  and injects it as `$vtor` ahead of the descriptor include, correct for both
  the MRAM-linked and RAM-run shapes. Inert until the descriptor reads `$vtor`
  (alp-sdk#947); an unreadable or unexpected ELF injects nothing and leaves
  Renode exactly as before.
- **The Renode smoke never actually booted, and reported success anyway.**
  `build_renode_argv` passed `--console --disable-xwt --hide-monitor --plain`;
  Renode 1.16.1 rejects that combination outright — "--hide-monitor and
  --console cannot be set at the same time" — printing its usage page and
  exiting **0**, so `tan renode` reported a clean smoke while nothing was ever
  simulated. `--hide-monitor` was redundant (Renode's own `--disable-xwt` help:
  "It automatically sets HideMonitor") and is gone. A new `renode_rejected_argv`
  guard latches Renode's own refusal wording off the console and fails the run
  (`renode.argv-rejected`, exit 1) regardless of exit status, so the next
  incompatible flag cannot pass silently either.
- **`tan flash` could not find the `west` that `tan build` uses.** `west` is
  installed INSIDE the `tan bootstrap` venv, and nothing activates that venv for
  a GUI-launched editor, so the ambient PATH has none. `tan build` has resolved
  the west-capable workspace venv since #106; `tan flash` only ever probed PATH,
  so on such a host a build succeeded and the flash that followed failed every
  Zephyr slice with `flash: slice '<core>' backend 'zephyr_west_flash' needs one
  of ["west"] on PATH; none found.` The venv resolution moved out of
  `commands::build` into a shared `venv` module; `flash` now uses it for the
  required-tool gate, for the backend's argv (the program is spawned by its
  absolute venv path), and for the child's PATH (so nested `west`/`python`
  resolve too). The tool-probing plan builders (`swd_probe`, `yocto_wic`) see
  the venv as well. With no west-capable venv — CI, an activated venv, the
  contract harness — every argv and message stays byte-identical to before.
  (#59)

### Added
- **`tan renode --core <CORE_ID>`** — boot ONE Zephyr slice of a multicore
  project in the headless smoke. A manifest with more than one Zephyr slice (an
  E1M-AEN801's `m55_hp` + `m55_he`) was refused outright with "the Renode smoke
  boots a single-Zephyr-slice system", leaving no way to smoke-test such a
  project at all. `--core` narrows the zephyr set before the runnable filter, so
  an explicitly named blocked/skipped slice still boots exactly like a lone one
  does (the smoke touches no hardware). A name matching no zephyr slice fails
  with `UnknownCore`, listing the manifest's zephyr cores. The refusal message
  now names the flag. Unchanged for a single-slice project.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-07-24

### Added
- **Zero-flag default-SDK resolution** — a new machine-global SDK default
  tier sits between the project pin and auto-discovery: `tan sdk switch
  --global` pins `~/.alp/sdk-default` (same shape as the project pin);
  `tan init` now resolves the new project's SDK through the full four-tier
  precedence (`sdkRootFlag` > `projectPin` > `globalDefault` > `discovery`
  > `none`) and pins it into the new project's `.alp/sdk-path` without a
  separate `tan sdk switch` step; `tan sdk current --json` reports which
  tier resolved via the new `sourceTier` field (#32).
- **`tan kconfig`** — board-scoped Kconfig symbol menu for one core (the
  vscode `prj.conf` LSP's live feed), wrapping the SDK's `alp_orchestrate
  --emit kconfig --core <id>` (alp-sdk #894) in the standard
  `Envelope<KconfigData>`. Workspace-dependent — the SDK's one deliberate
  exception to "every emit is hermetic" — so `tan kconfig` resolves
  `ZEPHYR_BASE` via the same workspace/venv resolver `tan build` already
  uses and fails loud (exit 2, `run 'tan bootstrap' first`) when no
  bootstrapped workspace resolves, instead of spawning the emit for a
  cryptic Python failure. `--core` defaults to the board's one declared
  Zephyr core when unambiguous; otherwise it's required, with an error
  naming the board's declared cores (#35).

### Changed
- **Release notes** — `release.yml` now slices the matching `## [X.Y.Z]`
  section out of `CHANGELOG.md` and publishes it as the GitHub Release body
  instead of an empty one (v0.2.0 shipped with no notes) (#30).
- **New golden-envelope contract test** (`crates/tan-cli/tests/
  contract.rs`) pins the JSON envelope shape of the vscode-parsed commands
  (`init`, `generate`, `validate`, `sdk`) across six offline, deterministic
  cases plus the `tan --version` format, so an accidental wire-format
  change fails `cargo test` instead of surfacing as a silent extension
  regression. Test infrastructure only; no change to `tan`'s own runtime
  behavior (#7).
- **Release assets** — the Linux `-gnu` binaries are now cross-built with
  `cargo-zigbuild` against a pinned **glibc 2.31** floor instead of inheriting
  the ubuntu-latest runner's own glibc (2.39, which broke consumers on older
  distros with `GLIBC_2.39 not found`); two new fully-static
  `-unknown-linux-musl` assets (x86_64 + aarch64) ship alongside them for
  Alpine/container consumers and arm64 Linux (no arm runner needed). Every
  release asset, plus a new `checksums.txt`, now carries a GitHub
  build-provenance attestation (`gh attestation verify`) (#6, #20).

### Fixed
- **`tan bootstrap` could silently pull the wrong SDK's west manifest.**
  After `tan sdk switch` between two cached SDK versions sharing a `.west`
  topdir, the "already initialised" path ran `west update` without
  reconciling `.west/config`'s `[manifest] path`, so it kept pulling the
  FIRST SDK's manifest. `tan bootstrap` (unless `--no-west`) now reconciles
  `manifest.path` against the resolved SDK root before shelling
  `bootstrap.sh`, preserving CRLF line endings and rewriting the file
  atomically (#31).
- **`tan kconfig`'s symbol deserialization now requires every key the
  SDK's `--emit kconfig` always emits** (`depends`/`help`/`symbols`)
  instead of silently defaulting a renamed/missing key to empty; the
  vendored `tests/fixtures/kconfig-contract/emit-kconfig.golden.json`
  contract anchor is now byte-diffed against alp-sdk's own canonical
  fixture by `tests/parity/kconfig_fixture_parity.py` in CI (#40).

## [0.2.0] — 2026-07-22

### Added
- **Build-plan token-substitution pass (alp-sdk #865, "hermetic build
  plans").** `tan_core::plan_tokens::substitute_plan_tokens` swaps
  `${SDK_ROOT}`/`${PROJECT_ROOT}`/`${PYTHON}` for tan's already-resolved
  values in every path-bearing plan string, gated on the additive top-level
  `planPathMode: "tokened"` field — a no-op on every plan the SDK emits
  today. Guards: a leftover `${...}` token after substitution fails loudly;
  a `--plan-from` plan's `sdkCommit` is checked against the resolved SDK
  checkout's actual `git` HEAD (the two-SDK split-brain guard); `${PROJECT_ROOT}`
  diverging from the executor's actual base dir refuses the build rather than
  silently building against the wrong tree.
- **`tan init`'s `zephyr-app` template now scaffolds from alp-sdk's vendored
  `--emit scaffold` output** (alp-sdk #864), retiring tan's own hand-rolled
  Rust scaffold generators — which had regressed a cross-core Kconfig leak.
  A cross-repo byte-parity gate (`tests/parity/scaffold_byte_parity.py`) holds
  the vendored `minimal` E1M-AEN801/E1M-V2N101 trees byte-identical to the
  SDK's emit.

### Changed
- **Seam-1 parity twin retuned to shape-only comparison** (alp-sdk #874/#879).
  The vendored comparator no longer diffs each slice's materialised
  config-artefact contents (`alp.conf`/`local.conf`/`cmake-args.txt`/
  sysbuild-conf bytes) against the frozen oracle — only command / env /
  `appDir` / skip-fail-decision shape — so a content-only emitter change no
  longer needs a hand-reviewed comparator strip to stay green. Test/CI
  infrastructure only; no change to `tan`'s own runtime behavior.
- **Seam-1 twin reconciled with alp-sdk #865's tokenized plans**: the
  comparator now maps a live `planPathMode: "tokened"` plan's
  `${SDK_ROOT}`/`${PROJECT_ROOT}` tokens onto the same normalized form the
  frozen (pre-#865, absolute-path) oracle collapses to, instead of diffing
  them as a foreign shape; the frozen `iot-fleet-ota` oracle fixture was
  re-synced to alp-sdk's #862-corrected bytes.

### Fixed
- **Re-vendored the `zephyr-app` scaffold from a corrected `--emit scaffold`**
  (alp-sdk #877): the E1M-V2N101 tree had shipped the non-buildable Alif
  `m55_hp` core (corrected to the Renesas `m33_sm` core) and a bare Zephyr
  board target, now the fully-qualified `board/soc/core` form; the
  `ALP_SDK_ROOT` CMake resolution now hard-errors instead of silently
  falling back to a relative-path guess. `tan init --cores` validation now
  derives the `zephyr-app` template's expected core from the vendored
  scaffold's own ground truth rather than the SKU-prefix heuristic every
  other template uses, fixing a latent E1M-NX9101 core mismatch in the
  process.
- **`tan build`/`flash`/`renode`'s "not built yet" error hints now say
  `tan build --project <path>`** — `build` takes no positional path
  argument, so the previous bare `tan build <path>` hint named an
  invocation clap rejects.

## [0.1.1] — 2026-07-20

A full adversarially-verified codebase review found data-loss and
hardware-programming defects in the 0.1.0 surface; this section is the fix set.
The unifying cause: external file content (`board.yaml`, the build plan, the
system manifest) was parsed leniently — correct for reading — but its unvalidated
strings then flowed into `remove_dir_all`, flash argv, and host-vs-hardware
decisions. Validated *acting* is now separated from tolerant *reading*.

### Security / data-loss
- **`tan clean` could delete the entire project tree.** A `--build-root` of `""`
  (an unset `$VAR`), `.`, or `..`, and a system-manifest slice `build_dir` of
  `""` / `.` / `/` / `../..`, each resolved to the project root or a filesystem
  root and were passed to `remove_dir_all`, exiting `0`. New shared guard
  `tan_core::path_guard::is_unsafe_removal_target` screens **every** removal
  target (build root and manifest-derived alike); a refused target is reported as
  a `clean.unsafe-target` error and fails the command, never silently cleaned.
- **Windows path-escape in the plan/manifest write paths.** The
  `is_absolute() || has ParentDir` guard missed `/x`, `\x` and `C:x` (none are
  `is_absolute()` on Windows, yet each makes `base.join()` discard the base).
  Replaced everywhere with `tan_core::path_guard::is_plain_relative` —
  materialise, the post-build manifest write, slice `cwd`, image archive names
  (`slice_archive_name`), `sdk install <version>`, and `init --name`.
- **`tan flash` could program the wrong address / a stale artefact.** An unquoted
  YAML `base:` that parsed as a number read as *absent* and silently defaulted to
  `0x08000000`; a *skipped* slice kept its plan-time artefact and was flashed
  after a green build. Flash args are now read strictly (a wrong-type scalar
  hard-errors, naming the key), and a slice whose `status != ok` is refused with
  a `flash.slice-not-built` error rather than programmed.
- **Build-root drift could leave `flash` reading a stale manifest.**
  `flash`/`size`/`image`/`renode` each read `<project>/build/system-manifest.yaml`,
  but the native build wrote the manifest under the plan's `buildRoot`. A plan
  emitting `buildRoot != "build"` would write elsewhere while those consumers
  read a stale one still under `build/`. The native build now refuses such a plan
  with a `build.unsupported-build-root` error instead of building where the rest
  of the suite cannot find the result.

### Fixed
- **`tan run --flash` could program hardware on a host project** (and `tan run`
  could execute a stale host binary). Host-vs-hardware is now decided from the
  build that just ran — an in-memory `NativeBuildOutcome` — never by re-reading a
  post-build `system-manifest.yaml` that a best-effort write may have left stale.
- **Silent data loss on every successful build.** The post-build manifest rewrite
  used the typed serializer that drops additive fields (rpmsg IPC carve-outs,
  `hw_info.eeprom`); it now uses the raw round-trip that preserves them.
- **`executionPolicy.unknownBackend` is now enforced** per the consumer contract
  (default fail), and a completion script drift check, JSON-envelope Issues for
  conditions previously reported only in text mode, and numerous smaller
  correctness/cross-platform fixes across `sdk`, `doctor`, `size`, `renode`,
  `image`, `validate`, and `init`.

### Changed
- **MSRV corrected to 1.86** (was declared 1.85). Edition 2024 needs 1.85, but
  the locked `ureq` → `url` → `idna` → `icu_*` tree needs 1.86 — building from
  source on 1.85 already failed. CI now verifies the declared value.
- **CI** — fmt/clippy run once on Linux; build + test now run on Linux, Windows,
  **and** macOS (the platforms a release ships assets for); every cargo call in
  both `ci` and `release` uses `--locked`; in-flight *pull-request* runs are
  superseded on a new push (a push to `main` is never cancelled).

## [0.1.0] — 2026-07-20

First public release of the `tan` executor CLI (alp-sdk ADR-0020 end-state B):
`tan` consumes the alp-sdk *build-plan* and executes it.

### Added
- **Build-plan consumer** — `tan build` runs natively off the SDK's
  `--emit build-plan`: materialise the per-slice files, then run each slice's
  command directly (no `west alp-build` extension command). Consumes the
  contract's `env` / `envAppendPath` and top-level `executionPolicy`, with a
  `schemaVersion` version-skew guard.
- **Native commands** — `clean`, `size`, `image`, `flash`, and `renode` ported
  to native Rust, retiring their `west alp-*` forwarders. `size` reads ELF
  sections directly, so it measures without an external `size` tool.
- **`tan run`** — build, then run on the host (native_sim) or program hardware.
  Flashing hardware requires an explicit `--flash`; a bare `tan run` never
  programs the board.
- **Release pipeline** — a tag-triggered per-platform build publishing raw
  `tan-<triple>[.exe]` binaries for six targets (see `docs/release-contract.md`).
- Post-build **system-manifest** seam (`build/system-manifest.yaml`).

### Changed
- Only `migrate` / `lock` / `quality` still forward to the surviving
  `west alp-*` extension commands; every other build/inspect command is native.

### Fixed
- `zephyr_west_flash`: `flash_args.runner` is now **optional**. When absent,
  `--runner` is omitted and `west flash` defers to the board.cmake default
  runner (e.g. AEN801's `alif_flash`) instead of hard-erroring.

### Removed
- The legacy `tan build --west` delegate.
