## [0.1.0] — 2026-07-20

First public release of the `tan` executor CLI (alp-sdk ADR-0020 end-state B):
`tan` consumes the alp-sdk *build-plan* and executes it.

### Added
- **Build-plan consumer** — `tan build` runs natively off the SDK's
  `--emit build-plan`: materialise the per-slice files, then run each slice's
  command directly (no `west alp-build` extension command). Consumes the
  contract's `env` / `envAppendPath` and top-level `executionPolicy`, with a
  `schemaVersion` version-skew guard.
- **Native commands** — `clean`, `size`, `image`, `flash`, and `renode` ported
  to native Rust, retiring their `west alp-*` forwarders. `size` reads ELF
  sections directly, so it measures without an external `size` tool.
- **`tan run`** — build, then run on the host (native_sim) or program hardware.
  Flashing hardware requires an explicit `--flash`; a bare `tan run` never
  programs the board.
- **Release pipeline** — a tag-triggered per-platform build publishing raw
  `tan-<triple>[.exe]` binaries for six targets (see `docs/release-contract.md`).
- Post-build **system-manifest** seam (`build/system-manifest.yaml`).

### Changed
- Only `migrate` / `lock` / `quality` still forward to the surviving
  `west alp-*` extension commands; every other build/inspect command is native.

### Fixed
- `zephyr_west_flash`: `flash_args.runner` is now **optional**. When absent,
  `--runner` is omitted and `west flash` defers to the board.cmake default
  runner (e.g. AEN801's `alif_flash`) instead of hard-erroring.

### Removed
- The legacy `tan build --west` delegate.
