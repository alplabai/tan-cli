# ADR-0020 parity gate

`tan` (this repo) is the sole executor for the Alp Lab build (ADR-0020, end-state
B). alp-sdk's planner is the fast-moving half of that split, so a planner
change that emits fine but builds wrong must be caught before it reaches a
release, not discovered on a bench. This directory seeds the gate ADR-0020's
2026-07-20 Amendment (alp-sdk#855) says is release-blocking: a **two-seam
parity gate** plus a **cross-repo trigger** so alp-sdk CI can drive it on
every planner change.

## The two seams

| Seam | Checks | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **1 — plan shape** | Does a live `--emit build-plan` still match a frozen, hand-verified oracle, field for field, over the SoM matrix — command + env + skip/fail-decision equivalence? Toolchain-free; runs on any `ubuntu-latest` runner. | **Implemented here**: `seam1_field_diff.py` + `.github/workflows/parity.yml`'s `seam1-plan-shape` job. |
| **2 — real build** | Materialise byte-check, an actual `west`/Zephyr build off the plan, and a Renode smoke test — the thing seam 1 can't catch (a plan that *looks* right but doesn't build). | **Follow-up, not seeded here.** Needs a Linux runner with the Zephyr SDK / toolchain installed (`west`, the AEN/E1M-X Zephyr modules, Renode). Placeholder `seam2` job in `.github/workflows/parity.yml` documents this — it does not run a fake check and does not report success for work it didn't do. |

Yocto/A-core artefact parity is explicitly **out of scope** for both seams —
no bitbake-capable runner infra exists, and bitbake output isn't
byte-reproducible (ADR-0020, "Phase-3 parity gate").

## Why the oracle is frozen at `97ad481b`

`tests/parity/oracle/*.build-plan.json` were captured at alp-sdk commit
`df312cec^` == `97ad481b` ("feat(build-plan): publish envAppendPath +
executionPolicy (ADR-0020 Phase 1, additive)", #847).

That specific SHA matters: it is the **last** alp-sdk commit that carries
*both*

- `Orchestrator.fan_out()` — the in-repo SDK-side executor, which until
  `df312cec` (#848, "retire the SDK executor, tan is sole executor") was
  still alive and usable as a real, in-repo build oracle; and
- the Phase-1 contract fields `tan` depends on today — per-slice
  `envAppendPath` and the top-level `executionPolicy`.

`df312cec` retires `fan_out` and every SDK-side executor outright (no legacy
shim survives that migration — ADR-0020 is explicit that there is no
rollback after Phase 4). After that commit there is no SDK-side executor left
to diff a live emit against, ever again. `97ad481b` is therefore the last
frame in which "does the live emit still match what the last real in-repo
oracle produced" is even an answerable question — freezing it now is
reconstructing that oracle retroactively, per the Amendment's remediation
step, not a routine fixture update.

## Why the comparator normalizes two fields

A `build-plan.json` is **not hermetic** — it embeds facts about the checkout
that emitted it, not just the board it plans for:

- **the checkout-root absolute path**, in `env.ALP_SDK_ROOT`, every
  `envAppendPath.*` entry, each slice's `appDir`, and (for sysbuild slices)
  embedded mid-string inside `command.args` (`-DSB_CONF_FILE=<root>/a;<root>/b`,
  which isn't a root-prefixed string outright — the comparator does a global
  substring replace, not a prefix check, to catch this);
- **`sdkCommit`**, the emitting commit's short SHA.

Neither is a real parity break — they differ by construction between the
oracle's `97ad481b` capture checkout and whatever checkout is emitting the
live plan under test. `seam1_field_diff.py` normalizes both before diffing:
the checkout root (discovered from the plan's own
`slices[0].env.ALP_SDK_ROOT` — nothing is hardcoded) is replaced everywhere
with the literal token `__SDKROOT__`, and `sdkCommit` is replaced with
`__SHA__`.

## The one allowed delta: `debug.probe`

After normalization, the **only** field allowed to differ between the oracle
and a live emit is `slices[*].debug.probe`, and only in the direction
`"openocd"` (oracle, captured at `97ad481b`) `->` `null` (`df312cec` and
later). This is `#848`'s intentional, hand-reviewed change: the SDK-side
executor named a concrete debug-probe runner because it drove `west`/OpenOCD
itself; post-ADR-0020 the SDK doesn't own flashing at all (`tan` does), so
asserting `probe: "openocd"` would be a claim the SDK can no longer honestly
make. `null` means "the SDK isn't naming a probe" — a downgrade to
not-claiming, not a hidden capability loss. ADR-0020's Amendment states this
explicitly: "the only `97ad481b`<->`df312cec` emit delta is `debug.probe`
`"openocd"->null`, hand-reviewed."

Any other diff anywhere in the plan — a changed command, a changed `env`
value, a changed slice count, a `probe` change to anything other than that
exact transition — **fails** the gate. See `seam1_field_diff.py`'s module
docstring for the exact allowed-delta rule the comparator implements.

## Running it locally

```
python3 tests/parity/seam1_field_diff.py \
  --sdk /path/to/an/alp-sdk/checkout \
  --oracle tests/parity/oracle
```

`--boards` restricts the check to specific oracle fixtures (filename minus
`.build-plan.json`, e.g. `--boards audio_i2s-tone multicore_rpmsg-v2n`);
omitted, it checks every fixture in `--oracle`. Exit code is `0` iff every
board's only diffs (if any) are the allowed `debug.probe` delta.

## CI wiring

`.github/workflows/parity.yml` runs `seam1-plan-shape` on every pull request
(against a pinned alp-sdk tag — see the workflow's `PINNED_SDK_TAG` comment)
and on a `repository_dispatch` of type `alp-sdk-planner-change` (the
cross-repo trigger ADR-0020's Amendment requires: alp-sdk CI fires this on
every planner change so a drifting emit surfaces on the *alp-sdk* PR, not
discovered later against a stale checkout). The dispatch payload's
`client_payload.sdk_ref` picks the exact SDK ref under test.
