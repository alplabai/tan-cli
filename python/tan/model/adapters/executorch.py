"""ExecuTorch passthrough adapter (host model compiler).

ExecuTorch programs are exported ahead of time on the ML-engineer's side
(``torch.export`` + ``to_edge_transform_and_lower``), the same way a
``.tflite`` flatbuffer arrives pre-compiled for CpuAdapter: there is no
alp-sdk-invoked host toolchain step, only a byte passthrough of the exported
``.pte`` program into the ``.alpmodel`` package.

``backend`` is ``"cpu"`` -- ExecuTorch is a CPU-tier program format, an
alternative to plain TFLM ``.tflite`` for that same tier, not a distinct
physical accelerator (see ``ALP_INFERENCE_BACKEND_*`` in
``include/alp/inference.h``: cpu | ethos_u | drpai | deepx_dxm1, no
"executorch" backend). It IS registered in ``build.py``'s default
``_ADAPTERS`` list alongside ``CpuAdapter`` -- both carry ``backend ==
"cpu"``, and ``build_model()`` selects between them per model by
``accepts(src_fmt)``, not by registration order: a ``.tflite`` source still
resolves to ``CpuAdapter`` (this adapter's ``accepts()`` rejects it), a
``.pte`` source resolves here. No board's existing TFLite build is affected;
`alp model build` reaches this adapter automatically the moment a board.yaml
`models[].source` ends in ``.pte``.

The device-side format decode (blob_format string "executorch" ->
``ALP_INFERENCE_MODEL_EXECUTORCH``) is ``_fmt_enum()`` in
``src/backends/inference/alp_model_select.c``; there is still no on-device
ExecuTorch *runtime* backend (issue #1260 closes the write-side gap only --
the SDK can now describe and produce an ExecuTorch blob, not yet run one)."""
