# mproc-mailbox

Per-peripheral example for `<alp/mproc.h>`.  Demonstrates the
M55-HP side of a Cortex-M55-HP ↔ Cortex-M55-HE mailbox roundtrip
on AEN: stage a payload in shared SRAM, signal the peer via the
hardware mailbox, wait for a reply, read the result back.

## What this shows

- Opening a shared-memory region (`alp_shmem_open`) and a
  hardware mailbox (`alp_mbox_open`) by portable instance IDs.
- Resolving a raw pointer view of the shared region with
  `alp_shmem_view()`, then staging payload bytes by `memcpy`
  through that pointer (the surface hands back a base pointer +
  size and trusts the caller to write through it; the backend
  handles cache-coherency for `cacheable = false` regions).
- Signalling the peer with `alp_mbox_send` carrying a small
  tuple (offset + length) that points at the staged bytes.
- Receiving the reply through an inbound callback registered with
  `alp_mbox_set_callback()` -- it fires on the SDK's mbox thread
  with the peer's (offset, length) tuple, which `main()` then
  drains.
- Reading the peer's echo response back from shared SRAM via the
  same pointer view.

## Build

### native_sim (no peer core; HP-side init only)

```bash
west build -b native_sim/native/64 .
west build -t run
```

Expected output:

```
[mproc] init mbox + shmem
[mproc] sending payload  "hello-from-HP" (13 bytes)
[mproc]   native_sim: no peer core; skipping reply
[mproc] done
```

### Real silicon (AEN dual-core, both images built from this project)

The peer-side firmware lives at
[`examples/multicore/mproc-mailbox/peer/main.c`](peer/main.c) -- HE-side
image that waits on the same mbox, reads the staged shmem
payload, and writes back an echo via reverse send.

`board.yaml` declares both `m55_hp` (`app: ./src`) and `m55_he`
(`app: ./peer`) as real project cores, so one `tan build` now
produces both images -- no more topology-default `alp-stock-shim`
placeholder on the HE side:

```bash
tan build --project .
```

Each core can also be built standalone with `west build` directly
(e.g. while iterating on one side):

```bash
# HP side.
west build -b ensemble_e8_dk/ae822fa0e5597ls0/rtss_hp .
west flash

# HE side.
west build -b ensemble_e8_dk/ae822fa0e5597ls0/rtss_he examples/multicore/mproc-mailbox/peer
west flash
```

Flash both into the matching SoC partitions (HP -> RTSS-HP slot,
HE -> RTSS-HE slot) and the roundtrip completes:

```
[mproc] init mbox + shmem
[mproc] sending payload  "hello-from-HP" (13 bytes)
[mproc-peer] request offset=0 len=13
[mproc-peer] payload  "hello-from-HP"
[mproc-peer] replied "echo: hello-from-HP" (19 bytes)
[mproc] HE replied via mbox callback
[mproc] HE replied       "echo: hello-from-HP" (19 bytes)
[mproc] done
```

## Reference

- [`<alp/mproc.h>`](https://github.com/alplabai/alp-sdk/blob/v0.16.0/include/alp/mproc.h) -- mailbox + shmem
  + hwsem API.
- [`docs/v1.0-readiness.md`](https://github.com/alplabai/alp-sdk/blob/v0.16.0/docs/v1.0-readiness.md) §4 --
  this example is one of the v1.0 reference-app flagships; both the
  HP host and the HE peer now build from this one project, with
  HiL verification of the round-trip still ahead.

## Before you run this: the channel is not allocated yet

`E1M-AEN801` carries no `memory_map:` in its SoM metadata, so this project's
shared-memory carve-out cannot be placed and resolves `blocked`:

```
name: alp_shmem0  kind: raw_shmem  status: blocked
reason: memory_map.base is TBD for region 'mram_main' in SoM E1M-AEN801; this
        SoM hasn't been HW-mapped yet so IPC carve-outs cannot be allocated.
```

The project still configures and builds, and `--emit ipc-contract-h` still
exits 0 -- it emits `ALP_IPC_*_ADDR 0x0u /* stub: blocked */`. So the mailbox
roundtrip this example teaches compiles and does nothing until that metadata
lands. This is
mapping work not yet done upstream, not a limit of the design.
