 * i2c-master -- discrete I2C master that reads a known device at
 * a known address.
 *
 * Pattern: open the bus, init the chip driver, loop reading the
 * register every second, close cleanly.  Contrasts with alp-sdk's
 * examples/peripheral-io/i2c-scanner (not part of this scaffolded
 * project), which probes every 7-bit address for ACKs without
 * knowing what's behind them.
 *
 * Hardware: the BMP581 barometer sits on BOARD_I2C_SENSORS on every
 * E1M and E1M-X EVK, strapped to 7-bit address 0x47 (SDO -> VDDIO)
 * on both -- see metadata/boards/e1m-evk.yaml and
 * metadata/boards/e1m-x-evk.yaml `i2c_devices:`.  On a brand-new
 * bring-up you may want to build and run the alp-sdk repo's
 * examples/peripheral-io/i2c-scanner example first to confirm which
 * address ACKs -- it isn't part of this scaffolded project.
 *
 * (#1269: this example used to target the TMP112 temperature
 * sensor, but TMP112 lives on BRD_I2C, not on BOARD_I2C_SENSORS --
 * opening BOARD_I2C_SENSORS and probing for TMP112 NACKs on real
 * hardware.  On the E1M-AEN family BRD_I2C is additionally the
 * slave-only Alif LPI2C0 -- ADR 0017 -- so the SoC can't master it
 * at all; see examples/v2n/v2n-temp-sensor for the V2N-only
 * BRD_I2C/TMP112 pattern.)
 *
 * What success looks like (real hardware):
 *
 *   [i2c-master] open BOARD_I2C_SENSORS @ 400 kHz
 *   [i2c-master] bmp581_init @ 0x47 -> 0 (OK)
 *   [i2c-master] sample 0: 96234 Pa, 23.625 degC
 *   [i2c-master] sample 1: 96231 Pa, 23.687 degC
 *   ...
 *   [i2c-master] done
 *
 * On native_sim (CI lane) the alp-i2c0 alias maps to the emul I2C
 * driver -- no BMP581 is registered as a target, so bmp581_init
 * gets NACKed and the example exits with the diagnostic.  Either
 * way the [i2c-master] done marker latches the harness.
