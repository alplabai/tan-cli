 * i2c-master -- discrete I2C master that reads a known device at
 * a known address.
 *
 * Pattern: open the bus, init the chip driver, loop reading the
 * register every second, close cleanly.  Contrasts with
 * examples/peripheral-io/i2c-scanner which probes every 7-bit address for ACKs
 * without knowing what's behind them.
 *
 * Hardware: the TMP112 +/-0.5 C temperature sensor sits on the
 * BRD_I2C management bus on every E1M-AEN, E1M-V2N, and E1M-V2N-M1
 * SoM per metadata/chips/tmp112.yaml.  7-bit address depends on
 * the ADD0 strap, which selects one of 0x48..0x4B; every current
 * SoM family straps ADD0 = GND, so the address is 0x48 throughout.
 * On a brand-new bring-up you may want to run examples/peripheral-io/i2c-scanner
 * first to confirm which address ACKs.
 *
 * What success looks like (real hardware):
 *
 *   [i2c-master] open BOARD_I2C_SENSORS @ 400 kHz
 *   [i2c-master] tmp112_init @ 0x48 -> 0 (OK)
 *   [i2c-master] sample 0: 23.625 degC
 *   [i2c-master] sample 1: 23.687 degC
 *   ...
 *   [i2c-master] done
 *
 * On native_sim (CI lane) the alp-i2c0 alias maps to the emul I2C
 * driver -- no TMP112 is registered as a target, so tmp112_init
 * gets NACKed and the example exits with the diagnostic.  Either
 * way the [i2c-master] done marker latches the harness.
