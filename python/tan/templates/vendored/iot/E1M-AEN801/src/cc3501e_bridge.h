 * One-call bring-up of the E1M-AEN SoM's CC3501E Wi-Fi 6 / BLE coprocessor over the
 * inter-chip SPI bridge -- the SoM bring-up TEMPLATE for applications.
 *
 * The CC3501E is part of the SoM (module U4 = BDE-BW35N): the application does NOT
 * touch the raw SPI bus or the WIFI_EN / nRESET control pins.  It calls
 * cc3501e_bridge_bringup() once, gets a ready @ref cc3501e_t, and from there uses the
 * portable surfaces:
 *   - cc3501e_* (chips/cc3501e)            -- MAC / Wi-Fi / BLE / GPIO-proxy / OTA
 *   - alp_gpio_open(ALP_E1M_GPIO_IOxx)         -- proxied E1M IOs (when the proxy is built)
 *
 * To reuse in your own AEN application: copy this pair (cc3501e_bridge.{c,h}) into your
 * app, or call cc3501e_bridge_bringup() directly.  The bus / pins / clock are the
 * E1M-AEN SoM defaults below; a board variant overrides only those macros -- the SoM
 * stays swappable without touching application code.

/* 25 MHz = 200 MHz SSI functional clock / 8.
 *
 * The CC3501E peripheral-mode maximum is 30 MHz, NOT the 15 MHz this comment
 * claimed for most of the bring-up: datasheet SWRS343A section 6.14.2.3.3,
 * `fsclk SPI clock frequency, Peripheral Mode, MAX 30 MHz` (Controller Mode is
 * 40 MHz).  Every earlier ceiling argument here was built on the wrong number.
 *
 * 25 MHz is the fastest LEGAL step available: the DW SSI BAUDR divisor must be
 * EVEN, so from 200 MHz the neighbours are /8 = 25 MHz and /6 = 33.3 MHz, and
 * 33.3 is 11% over the part's maximum.  Reaching exactly 30 MHz would require
 * retargeting the SSI functional clock itself (AE822 HWRM section 8.3.5) --
 * ALIF_SPI_CLK is a frequency-only dummy in the dtsi with no divider control,
 * so there is no software knob for it here.
 *
 * REQUIRES an RX sample delay: at a 40 ns bit period the MISO capture does not
 * land on its own.  That delay comes from CC3501E_BRIDGE_RX_SAMPLE_DLY below --
 * NOT from the SPI node's `rx-delay` property, which the poke in
 * cc3501e_bridge.c overwrites.  The measured working span is in that constant's
 * comment.
 *
 * It does not raise throughput -- silicon-measured
 * 2026-08-24: 682 kB/s at 25 MHz vs 678 kB/s at 14.29 MHz on PIO, 704 vs 701 on
 * DMA, because wire time is only ~554 us of a ~2459 us transaction and the rest
 * is per-frame protocol cost on both ends.  It is worth taking anyway: each
 * transfer occupies the bus for ~44% less time, which is CPU and bus budget
 * handed back to everything else on the SoM.
 *
 * The 14.29 MHz predecessor was scope-confirmed at 14.20-14.26 MHz, which is
 * what validates the 200 MHz functional-clock figure the divider assumes.  A
 * board with longer traces should re-check MISO capture before adopting 25 MHz.
 *
 * SEPARATE, PRE-EXISTING DEFECT (do not blame this clock for it): a bulk read
 * intermittently desyncs partway through -- roughly 1 run in 2-3, at anywhere
 * from 61 kB to 212 kB in -- and then never recovers for the caller's whole
 * retry budget.  It reproduces at 14.29 MHz TOO, so it is not a clock artifact.
 * Signature (host-side, request-header phase of CMD_SOCK_RECV 0x23): the
 * slave's in-band idle marker reads [02 00 00 00] once and then [00 00 00 00]
 * forever instead of A5 A5 A5 A5 -- i.e. the slave is stuck mid-reply on a
 * transfer it armed earlier and never completed.  With
 * SPI_TRANSFER_RETURN_PARTIAL deliberately off, a CS deassert does not complete
 * it, and NEITHER slave self-heal fires (g_resync_count does not move -- the
 * slave is not misframing; g_arm_fail_count does not move -- the arm succeeded).
 * Clocking a full idle frame from the host to satisfy the outstanding count was
 * tried and did NOT recover it.  The fix likely belongs on the slave: a
 * stall watchdog that calls bridge_transport_spi_hw_reinit() when an armed
 * transfer has not completed for N ms. */

 * to.  When set, cc3501e_reply_gate() (chips/cc3501e/cc3501e_core.c) can
 * only ever ADD delay to a reply phase, never remove it, so opting in on a
 * board where the wiring is wrong costs up to 3 x 250 ms of busy-wait per

 * on it -- longer thresholds apply after each re-latch if the line flaps
 * instead of staying cleanly stuck (chips/cc3501e/cc3501e_core.c's
 * g_ready_stuck_low_threshold) -- it is always safe to try FOR LINK TIMING.
 * It is not free, though: this
 * wait runs while cc3501e_request() holds its internal transport lock, so
 * a wrong or slow ready_pin can make another caller on the same ctx see
 * ALP_ERR_BUSY after CONFIG_ALP_SDK_CC3501E_REQUEST_LOCK_TIMEOUT_MS -- see

 * the CC3501E GPIO17 READY net lands on E1M pad G3 / IO16 instead
 * (metadata/e1m_modules/aen/from-cc3501e.tsv).  cc3501e_bridge_bringup()

/* DW SSI SPI1 base (0x48104000) + RX_SAMPLE_DLY to run the bridge SCLK above

 * on-SoM trace + crossed-data round-trip returns the CC35's bit, and anything
 * above 1 MHz mis-samples.  Setting it delays the capture by N ssi_clk
 * (200 MHz) cycles -- 5 ns per step.
 *
 * 4 is silicon-measured at the 25 MHz working point (40 ns bit period) on
 * E1M-AEN803 serial 2026W36-0002.  N was swept 0..10 with 0x481040F0 read back
 * each time to confirm the value took, using aen-evk-demo phase 8 as the
 * workload:
 *
 *   N = 0..7   PASS, 2-3 runs each: bring-up 0, PING on attempt 1 of 25,
 *              byte-exact MAC, scan 0, BLE 0.
 *   N = 8      FAIL, 3 runs of 3: bring-up still returns 0, but the link never
 *              answers -- PING -> -5 after all 25 attempts.
 *   N = 9      PASS, 2 runs of 2.
 *   N = 10     PASS, 3 runs of 3, but one run returned a MAC with a single bit
 *              flipped in byte 0.
 *
 * 4 is the centre of the measured-good 0..7 span: +4 steps (20 ns, half a bit
 * period) below the failure, and the low side is not a cliff at all since 0
 * itself is clean.  Do NOT read 8/9/10 as a monotone upper boundary -- 8
 * hard-fails while 9 and 10 pass, which this sweep did not explain.  Treat
 * everything above 7 as unqualified, not as graded margin.
 *
 * The "4..8 all clean cold+warm" window this comment used to claim was taken on
 * an earlier bench run at ~14.3 MHz -- a different board at roughly half the clock,
 * so it is not comparable and is not evidence for 25 MHz on this one.
 *
 * 0 does NOT mean "no delay": it compiles the poke out, leaving whatever the
 * SPI node's `rx-delay` property put there (see cc3501e_bridge.c).  Re-sweep if
 * the SoM trace lengths or the SCLK change. */
