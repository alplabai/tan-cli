# mqtt-telemetry

The **connected device** starting point: bring up Wi-Fi, open an
`mqtts://` (TLS) MQTT client, and publish a telemetry reading on a
cadence -- the whole path on the portable [`<alp/iot.h>`](https://github.com/alplabai/alp-sdk/blob/v0.16.0/include/alp/iot.h)
surface.

```
alp_wifi_open() -> alp_wifi_connect()          # Wi-Fi station up
alp_mqtt_open(mqtts://... , CA pinned)          # TLS MQTT client
alp_mqtt_connect() -> alp_mqtt_publish() x N    # publish telemetry
alp_mqtt_close()                                # clean disconnect
```

## Supported hardware -- AEN only

This template ships for **E1M-AEN801 only**. Its transport is the
**CC3501E Wi-Fi6+BLE coprocessor bridge**
([`docs/cc3501e-bridge.md`](https://github.com/alplabai/alp-sdk/blob/v0.16.0/docs/cc3501e-bridge.md)),
silicon-validated 2026-06-24. The app never names the bridge -- the
AEN board emit wires it as the `<alp/iot.h>` Wi-Fi backend from
`iot.wifi: true` in `board.yaml`.

The **E1M-V2N101 is deliberately not supported**: its Murata Wi-Fi
(`murata_lbee5hy2fy`) is `hil_silicon: untested` and its Linux-side
data path is an unmerged design, so there is no working Wi-Fi
transport for that family yet. Do not add it to a scaffold of this
template until that port lands.

## TLS status -- preview

The `mqtts://` path is configured through the portable API (broker URI + a
pinned CA) and **mbedTLS is now built in on every target**, native_sim
included. It used to be held off: with mbedTLS' PSA core disabled the pinned
library's own `ssl_misc.h` does not compile (`unknown type name
'mbedtls_error_pair_t'`), so the app turned mbedTLS off rather than fail. The
SDK now turns that PSA core on wherever it builds mbedTLS without TF-M
(`ALP_SDK_MBEDTLS_PSA_CRYPTO`, issue #2173), so this app carries no mbedTLS
knobs at all any more (see [`prj.conf`](https://github.com/alplabai/alp-sdk/blob/v0.16.0/examples/connectivity/mqtt-telemetry/prj.conf), which is
empty by design) and the `native_sim.conf` that used to hold the workaround is
deleted.

The record stays `preview` for a different reason: no Alif Ensemble entropy
driver exists yet, in this tree or upstream. An ordinary AEN hardware build is
therefore refused instead of silently using Zephyr's non-cryptographic
fallback. The AEN Twister scenario sets
`CONFIG_ALP_SDK_ALLOW_TEST_ENTROPY=y` only because it is `build_only`; that
image must never be flashed or shipped. A production AEN TLS build remains
blocked until the SE TRNG is wired to a real entropy driver (issue #2192).

## The "sensor reading"

To keep the focus on the transport, this template publishes a
**synthetic metric** (device uptime). Swap
`read_telemetry_value()` for a real sensor read -- e.g. compose it
with the [`sensor` template](https://github.com/alplabai/alp-sdk/tree/v0.16.0/examples/peripheral-io/i2c-master) (BMP581
over `<alp/chips/bmp581.h>`) -- and the publish path is unchanged.

## Build

```bash
# Standalone, native_sim (no radio, so the app prints the framing it
# would publish; mbedTLS is built in):
west build -b native_sim/native/64 . \
    -- -DEXTRA_ZEPHYR_MODULES=$ALP_SDK_ROOT
west build -t run

# On real silicon (E1M-AEN801):
west build -b alp_e1m_aen801_m55_hp/ae822fa0e5597ls0/rtss_hp .
west flash
```

## Expected output

native_sim (no Wi-Fi/MQTT backend; framing only):

```
[mqtt] alp-sdk mqtt-telemetry demo (publish over MQTT/TLS)
[mqtt] transport: CC3501E Wi-Fi bridge (E1M-AEN801)
[mqtt] wifi: opening station
[mqtt] wifi: alp_wifi_open -> NULL (ALP_ERR_NOT_READY)
[mqtt] no transport on this build -- printing framing only
[mqtt] would publish to alp/telemetry/e1m-aen801: {"device":"e1m-aen801-demo","metric":"uptime_s","value":0}
[mqtt] would publish to alp/telemetry/e1m-aen801: {"device":"e1m-aen801-demo","metric":"uptime_s","value":5}
[mqtt] would publish to alp/telemetry/e1m-aen801: {"device":"e1m-aen801-demo","metric":"uptime_s","value":10}
[mqtt] done
```

Real hardware (E1M-AEN801, associated + broker reachable):

```
[mqtt] wifi: associated to "alp-demo-ap"
[mqtt] broker: connected
[mqtt] publish 0 -> ALP_OK: {"device":"e1m-aen801-demo","metric":"uptime_s","value":0}
...
[mqtt] done
```
