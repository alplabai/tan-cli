"""Resolved memory-region view for the system manifest (alp-sdk#1365 item 3).

`resolve_memory_regions()` projects the SoM's effective memory-region table
into the `memory[]` pane `system-manifest-v1` declares -- the third pane
`ipc[]` and `storage[]` refer INTO by name, not a third copy of them.

Three vocabularies, each taken from what the code already produces rather
than from #1365's issue body (which predates splits A and B and proposes
shapes the shipped derivation cannot fill):

* `kind` is `aperture.classify_region()`'s own four verdicts --
  `flash` / `ram` / `unclassified` / `unresolved`. Collapsing them onto the
  issue's two (`ram` | `flash`) would have to invent a class for the two
  verdicts that exist precisely to say "not proven": `unclassified` (outside
  the aperture AND preset-authored -- an Ensemble OSPI XIP window is outside
  and still flash) and `unresolved` (no extent, or no aperture declared for
  this SoC at all, which is every non-Alif SoM).

* the authority field is `write_authority`, passed through verbatim with
  som-preset-v1's six values. The issue's 3-value `owner` was replaced
  during review because one axis cannot separate flash-time from runtime
  authority: `customer_image` and `customer_runtime` would both collapse to
  `customer`, which is the exact distinction the AEN `storage`-vs-`he_slot0`
  hazard needs. A row that authors no `write_authority` carries no key --
  absent means unresolved, never `customer_runtime` (ADR-0034 clause 4).

* `status` is `ok` / `unresolved`, the word this schema's own items
  description already made normative, not `ipc[]`'s `ok` / `blocked`. They
  are not synonyms: `blocked` is a verdict about an allocation request,
  while a region is a fact that either resolved an address or did not.

`source` is derived here rather than tagged in `alp_project.resolve_memory_map`
on purpose. That function's precedence is ALL-OR-NOTHING (an authored
`memory_map:` wins the whole table, else the SoC's fixed `memory_regions`,
else the silicon-variant derivation), so provenance is a property of the
table, not of a row -- `carveout.py` and `partition.py` already read it the
same way, via `bool(som_preset.get("memory_map"))`. Tagging rows inside the
loader would also add a key to dicts that flow into `$defs/memory_region`'s
`additionalProperties: false` validation path.

Depends only downward -- `som_metadata`, `aperture` and `memregion`; nothing
calls back into the package.
