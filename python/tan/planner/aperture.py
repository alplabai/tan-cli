"""SoC on-die flash aperture resolution + region classification (alp-sdk#1365 split B).

`resolve_aperture()` derives a SoM preset's declared on-die MRAM aperture so
`carveout.py` and `partition.py` can derive the same `flash` / `ram` /
`unclassified` / `unresolved` verdict for a `memory_map:` row, instead of
trusting the legacy `carveout:` flag outright.

Depends only downward -- som_metadata (`resolve_soc_path`,
`_resolve_silicon_variant`) and memregion (`_region_size_bytes`); nothing
calls back into the `tan.planner` package.

    (alp-sdk#1365 split B).

    Four verdicts. Containment is tested BEFORE `is_preset_authored` is
    ever consulted -- a derived row's extent can still prove `"flash"`,
    and skipping straight to `"ram"` for every non-authored row would
    discard that proof in the exact direction this module exists to
    protect (containment is ONE-SIDED: inside proves flash, outside
    proves nothing -- it does not follow that "not proven flash" means
    "safe to call RAM without looking"). Order of evaluation:

      1. `"unresolved"` -- the region's own `base` doesn't resolve, OR no
         aperture is declared for this SoC at all (`aperture is None`).
         There is nothing to compare in either case; callers must honour
         an authored flag (`write_authority`, or the legacy `carveout`)
         if one is present rather than guess. This is also what makes
         split B a provable no-op on every non-Alif SoM: with no declared
         aperture, EVERY row on that SoM lands here, so a caller that
         special-cases `aperture is None` before ever calling this
         function reproduces the pre-split-B behaviour byte-for-byte.

      2. `"flash"` -- the region's resolved extent is CONTAINED in the
         aperture (including the whole-device alias case, extent ==
         aperture exactly, e.g. `mram_main` once its `base` stops being
         `"TBD"`). Containment is proof regardless of authorship: the
         on-die MRAM aperture holds nothing else, so a DERIVED row that
         happens to sit inside it is flash too, not RAM by default.

      3. `"ram"` -- containment did NOT prove flash (the extent lies
         outside the aperture), AND the region was NOT authored by the
         SoM preset itself (a SoC-level `memory_regions` row, or a row
         `resolve_memory_map`'s derivation branch built from the silicon
         variant). RAM by construction, needs no authority -- these rows
         are what keep every V2N/V2M/NX9101 derivation byte-identical.

      4. `"unclassified"` -- containment did NOT prove flash, and the
         region WAS authored by the SoM preset. Containment is
         ONE-DIRECTIONAL: outside proves NOTHING -- Ensemble's OSPI XIP
         windows sit outside `[soc_flash_base, ...)` and are still flash,
         and the same OSPI0 controller carries a HyperRAM alongside the
         NOR on a different chip_select. A preset-authored row landing
         here needs `write_authority: customer_runtime` to be IPC-eligible
         (P1); a future authored OSPI XIP row must NOT silently become an
         IPC candidate just because it resolves outside the aperture.

    `atoc`, each a fine-grained slice of the on-die MRAM window). False
