"""Memory-region math shared across the resolvers -- a leaf.

The page granularity and the memory_map size-field -> bytes conversion, used by
both the carve-out resolver and the storage-partition resolver. A dependency-
free leaf (typing only) so each resolver imports it directly instead of one
reaching into the other (or back through the package __init__). Extracted as a
#285 leaf seam -- the same move as paths.py -- so the partition resolver lands
cleanly.

    Reads each field by its VALUE, not by key presence: the
    `memory_region` schema lets `size_kib` and `size_mib` each
    independently be an int or the literal `"TBD"`, so a `"TBD"` in one

    `{size_mib: "TBD", size_kib: 64}` must resolve via `size_kib`, not
    bail out because `size_mib` is present but unresolved). `size_kib`
    is checked first (alp-sdk#1365 split B fix).

    Returns None only when NEITHER field resolves to a usable integer.
