"""Curated third-party library layer (ADR 0018).

A project selects libraries with one top-level key::

    libraries: [lvgl, cmsis-dsp, nanopb]

Each name resolves to a manifest at ``metadata/libraries/<name>.yaml`` (the
single source of truth, validated by ``scripts/validate_metadata.py``).  This
module is the emit-side half: it loads the manifests, validates each selection
against the resolved SoM/core capabilities, and yields the per-OS wiring the
slice emitters (``kconfig.py``) splice into their fragments -- Zephyr Kconfig,
Yocto ``IMAGE_INSTALL``, baremetal cmake args -- through the ADR 0014 --emit
contract.  No forking, no fetching: west/OE own the actual pin (ADR 0017).

Design invariants:

* **Zero-diff when unused.**  A project that declares no ``libraries:`` gets
  byte-identical emit output -- every helper returns ``[]`` for an empty
  selection and the emitters guard on that.
* **Fail early, name the constraint.**  An incompatible selection raises
  ``OrchestratorError`` with the failing ``requires:`` constraint named, the
  same clear-error contract as schema validation, so ``alp doctor`` /
  alp-studio (which read the same manifests) can never disagree with emit.

``_emit_library_hw_backends`` + ``_SOC_FAMILY_TOKEN`` are RELOCATED from
alp-sdk's ``scripts/alp_project_emit/west_libs.py``. They land here because
this is already the library layer and ``kconfig.py`` already imports it, so the
lazy cross-repo import it used at ``_slice_alp_conf`` time is gone entirely --
that import was the single edge keeping ``alp_project`` (and through its
``_load_yaml``, the whole of ``alp_orchestrate``) loaded on the in-process path.
``west_libs``' own ``--emit west-libraries`` half did NOT move: that mode is
still owned and spawned by alp-sdk.

    implemented matching backend per accelerator class given the active
    SoM SKU and emit the matching `CONFIG_*=y` line.

    Match rules (per priority entry; checked in order, all specified
    keys must match):
      - `silicon:` key, if present, must equal the SKU's `silicon:`
        ref exactly (e.g. `alif:ensemble:e4`).  Lets us pin a backend
        to specific SoCs in a family -- Ethos-U85 on E4/E6/E8, but
        not on E3/E5/E7 which carry only U55.
      - `soc_family:` key, if present, must equal the SKU family
        token (`alif_ensemble`, `renesas_rzv2n`, ...).  Selects every
        SKU in that family.
      - `requires_cap:` key, if present, must name a capability flag
        in the SKU's `metadata/e1m_modules/<sku>.yaml` `capabilities:`
        block that resolves to a truthy value (`true` or a non-zero
        count).  Cleanest matcher when an accelerator is shared
        across families.
      - All three omitted = universal entry (e.g. plain FPU, generic
        DMA), matches any SKU.
      - `status: planned` / `status: stub` entries are retained as
        metadata for the roadmap but are not emitted as active build
        claims.

    RELOCATED from `scripts/alp_project_emit/west_libs.py`. Two mechanical
    changes, no behavioural one on the success path: the repo root is the BOUND
    SDK checkout (`REPO`) rather than a `__file__` sibling walk, and a malformed
    metadata YAML now raises `OrchestratorError` (the loader's own error) where
    alp-sdk's delegating wrapper turned it into `sys.exit`. A refusal that

    not, and in-process that interpreter is `tan`'s.
