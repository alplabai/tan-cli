# has NO conf under `meta-alp-sdk/conf/machine/` AND no entry here, so
# a new SKU cannot fall through both unnoticed.  It does NOT fire when
# a conf ships for a MACHINE listed here, and it does NOT fire when a

# proof the MACHINE builds (`e1m-aen801-a32.conf` and
# `e1m-aen701-a32.conf` both exist and are both still unbuildable).
# So this dict is NOT self-maintaining: removing an entry once its
# MACHINE genuinely builds is a human call, and nothing in CI will
# remind you.  Re-read the per-entry reasons below before trusting
# them; the gate's own docstring draws the same line.

# Five AEN A32-cluster carriers declare a `topology.a32_cluster.machine:`
# today (`metadata/e1m_modules/E1M-AEN{501,601,701,801,803}.yaml`); all
# five are unbuildable, split into two distinct failure classes -- do
# not conflate them:
#
#   * `e1m-aen801-a32.conf` has an ACTIVE, uncommented `require
#     conf/machine/devkit-e8.conf` -- and that file exists in NEITHER
#     branch of the public meta-alif-ensemble upstream (issue #1968), so
#     this MACHINE fails at BitBake's own parse step.
#   * `e1m-aen701-a32.conf`'s `require conf/machine/devkit-e7.conf` is
#     already commented out in-tree (its own header: "Until the layer is
#     vendored this require has no target ... intentional") -- unlike
#     AEN801, `devkit-e7.conf` DOES exist on meta-alif-ensemble's
#     `devkit-ex-b0` branch, but nothing here references it yet, so this
#     MACHINE parses with no DEFAULTTUNE / kernel provider / TF-A
#     platform set at all.
#   * `e1m-aen501-a32` / `e1m-aen601-a32` / `e1m-aen803-a32` ship NO
#     `meta-alp-sdk/conf/machine/*.conf` at all -- strictly MORE
#     unbuildable than the two above, since BitBake fails to find the
#     MACHINE before it can parse a single `require`. E1M-AEN803 is the
#     SoM issue #1982 names as the bench module.
#
# All five are unbuildable regardless of the above: meta-alif-ensemble
# declares `LAYERSERIES_COMPAT = "warrior zeus"` and is structurally
# incompatible with this repo's Scarthgap baseline (issue #1971:
# pre-honister override syntax, a stale 5.4 kernel pin, obsolete TF-A
# build knobs), so even a corrected/uncommented `require` (or a shipped
# conf, for the three missing ones) would not make any of them buildable
