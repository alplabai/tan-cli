    """Deterministic OUTPUT paths under `build_dir` (#610 §4) -- the
    WHERE, not a promise the files already exist (they don't until the
    slice is actually built).

    Zephyr's own CMake layout fixes these names: `cmake/modules/
    kernel.cmake` (`PROJECT_BINARY_DIR = CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR/
    zephyr`, `KERNEL_ELF_NAME`/`_BIN_NAME`/`_MAP_NAME`/`_SYMBOLS_NAME`/
    `_STAT_NAME`) always lands `zephyr.elf` / `.bin` / `.map` /
    `.symbols` / `.stat` in a `zephyr/` subdirectory of the build dir
    (`.symbols` / `.stat` are gated behind the opt-in `CONFIG_
    OUTPUT_SYMBOLS` / `CONFIG_OUTPUT_STAT`, same "doesn't exist until
    built/enabled" caveat as the rest); the top-level `CMakeLists.txt`
    forces `CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS` unconditionally, always to
    the build dir root, not the `zephyr/` subdirectory.  A Yocto
    slice's real output (the wic/ext4 image) lands under the *Yocto
    build tree's* own deploy dir -- outside this slice's `build_dir`,
    which only ever carries the `local.conf` fragment -- so there is
    no honest path to report.

    `baremetal` reports the ONE path its configure line GUARANTEES
    (tan-cli#550 -- the whole block used to be null, so a slice that
    produced no binary at all was indistinguishable from one that built
    fine): `outputDir`.  `_slice_command` passes
    `-DCMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY=$<1:<buildDir>/output>`, so every
    RUNTIME artifact the app links -- i.e. every `add_executable()`
    target -- lands there, on single- and multi-config generators alike
    (the `$<1:...>` generator expression is what suppresses the
    per-config subdirectory a multi-config generator would otherwise
    append).

    What `outputDir` does NOT license is the inverse reading.  An empty
    or absent `output/` after the build step does NOT prove the slice
    produced nothing: `CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY` governs
    `add_executable` targets ONLY, so a firmware app built as
    `add_library(fwcore STATIC ...)` plus a custom link/objcopy target
    builds cleanly (rc 0, `libfwcore.a` + `main.c.o` + `fw.elf`
    produced) and never creates `output/` at all -- measured, not
    assumed.  It is a deterministic PLACE TO LOOK, not a
    build-succeeded oracle.

    `compileCommands` stays null for baremetal even though the
    configure passes `-DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON`: CMake
    implements that variable "only by Makefile Generators and Ninja
    Generators.  It is ignored on other generators" (CMake's own docs
    for the variable), and this planner does not choose the generator.
    On Windows, whose default generator is Visual Studio, the file is
    never written -- so naming the path here would be exactly the
    artifacts-lie tan-cli#550 is about, pointed the other way.  A zephyr
    slice's `compileCommands` is a different case and stays: `west
    build` drives Ninja and Zephyr's own top-level `CMakeLists.txt`
    forces the variable on.

    `elf` / `bin` / `map` / `sizeReport` / `symbols` stay null for
    baremetal: the executable's NAME is the app's own `CMakeLists.txt`
    to pick, not an SDK convention this emitter may invent -- pinning
    the DIRECTORY is the strongest honest claim, which is exactly what
    `outputDir` carries.

    `has_command` is False for a slice whose `command` was BLOCKED
    (`command-unrooted` / `board-tree-missing` / `no-command`): nothing
    will ever configure that build dir, so every path below would be a
    dangling promise pinned by a configure that never runs.  Such a
    slice reports an all-null block.

    Consumed by `tan` (alplabai/tan-cli), which materialises the plan's
    files, runs each slice's command, and owns scheduling / caching /
    progress UX on top -- instead of re-implementing this planner.  The
    Wave C contract was settled 2026-06-04 with the alp-sdk-vscode team
    (docs/PROPOSAL-alp-build-core.md records that settlement); the real
    parser today is tan-cli, not the alp-sdk-vscode extension itself.

    Contract notes (locked with the consumer -- bump `schemaVersion`
    and flag in the CHANGELOG before changing the shape):

      * camelCase keys; `schemaVersion` is independent of board.yaml's
        schema version.
      * Every artefact carries its `contents` so the consumer's
        materialise step stays pure IO.  `_shared_artefacts` /
        `_slice_config_artefact` are the single sources both this emit
        and the Orchestrator's own materialise step read, so the two
        cannot drift.
      * No `inputHash` (the consumer computes its own cache key over
        the plan) and no `sequential` (parallelism policy belongs to
        the consumer's scheduler).
      * One slice per non-`off` core, sorted by coreId.  A slice this
        script cannot build yet (e.g. no `app:`) is carried with
        `command: null` plus a `no-command` warning -- never dropped,
        so the consumer can still report the core.  Same treatment for
        a zephyr slice whose `board:` target has no tree under
        `zephyr/boards/alp/` (`board-tree-missing`, issue #999): the
        plan never carries a `west build -b <board>` command that is
        guaranteed to fail Zephyr's own board lookup.
      * Write-free: nothing is created on disk.  (Command resolution
        stats the app dir to pick the CMakeLists.txt convention --
        read-only, same as the build itself.)
      * Per-slice tooling index (#610 §4, additive to schemaVersion 1 --
        never renamed/removed, see `metadata/schemas/build-plan-v1.
        schema.json`): `toolchain` (compiler identity --
        `_slice_toolchain`, keys `targetTriple`/`compiler`/`sysroot`/`id`),
        `artifacts` (deterministic OUTPUT paths under `buildDir`, not a
        promise they exist yet -- `_slice_artifacts`, keys `elf`/`map`/
        `bin`/`sizeReport`/`symbols`/`compileCommands`), and `debug`
        (headless console/probe selectors -- `_slice_debug`).  A field
        genuinely not derivable for a runtime (e.g. a Yocto slice's exact
        GCC triple) is null, never guessed.  (These three sub-objects'
        keys were corrected from an accidental snake_case to camelCase
        to match the rest of this contract -- see the CHANGELOG.)
      * Envelope provenance, additive to schemaVersion 1: `sdkVersion`
        (`metadata/sdk_version.yaml`'s `version:`, via `_sdk_version`)
        and `sdkCommit` (`git rev-parse --short HEAD` of this checkout,
        via `_sdk_commit`; `null` when git/`.git` isn't available -- never
        raises) so a cached/materialised plan can be traced back to the
