"""System-manifest emitter -- assembles system-manifest.yaml from the model.

`emit_system_manifest` renders the spec-§5.2 manifest (slices, carve-outs,
storage, helper-MCU block) off the parsed BoardProject + the resolved carve-outs
/ partitions; `_helper_mcus` builds the manifest's `helper_mcus[]` block (shared
with the Orchestrator's materialise path, which back-imports it). Extracted as
the #285 manifest emit seam.

    Source: the SoM preset's `helper_firmware:` list (Phase 3).  Each key
    the entry declares is projected INDEPENDENTLY -- how the image is
    written locally (flash_method + flash_args), how it is updated in the
    field (update_channel), and who may invoke the flash method
    (flash_policy) are three separate axes, and a helper may declare any
    combination.  The GD32 bridge declares all three: an
    `alp_ota_spi_bridge` channel for normal field updates AND a
    `recovery_only` swd_probe method for a bricked board.  Dropping the
    flash keys because a channel exists would DELETE that recovery path
    from the manifest rather than let `tan flash` decline it, so this
    function must never make one key's presence suppress another's
    (alp-sdk #1357).  `firmware_path` is entirely ABSENT from the row when
    the preset doesn't declare one (e.g. GD32 bridge SKUs pending a
    released binary, alp-sdk #852/#936) -- it is never emitted as `null`,
    because `system-manifest-v1.schema.json` types it `string` when present
    (the orchestrator does NOT fail the build on a missing helper firmware
    path -- the Renesas + Alif flash flows are independently scriptable).

    Every in-tree SoM preset carries a `helper_firmware:` list (no more
    Phase-1 stragglers), so there is no back-compat `on_module.{
    supervisor_mcu,wifi_ble}` fallback here -- no-legacy-compat.
