"""The hw_rev <-> SDK-version compatibility gate `metadata/sdk_version.yaml`
advertises.

That file has stated since it was written that `scripts/alp_project.py`
"refuses to emit when the requested hw_rev is outside
[min_sdk_version, max_sdk_version]", and that
`scripts/validate_board_yaml.py` runs "the same check, exit code 3 on
mismatch".  Neither existed: a grep for `min_sdk_version` across
`scripts/` returned nothing, so a customer whose upgraded SDK no longer
supported their board revision got a normal, successful emit and firmware
built against the wrong hardware assumptions (alp-sdk issue #1019).

This module is that check, relocated verbatim from alp-sdk's
`scripts/alp_orchestrate/sdk_compat.py`.  It is deliberately pure and
data-only so the comparison can be tested without a board.yaml, a
metadata tree, or a loader.

Scope, and what is deliberately NOT here: whether the requested revision
*exists* or is `status: reserved` is a different question with a different
failure mode, tracked separately (alp-sdk issue #1025).  This module
answers one thing -- given a revision that resolved, does the running SDK
version fall inside the range that revision declares.
