"""The hw_rev <-> SDK-version compatibility gate `metadata/sdk_version.yaml`
advertises.

That file has stated since it was written that `scripts/alp_project.py`
"refuses to emit when the requested hw_rev is outside
[min_sdk_version, max_sdk_version]", and that
`scripts/validate_board_yaml.py` runs "the same check, exit code 3 on
mismatch".  Neither existed: a grep for `min_sdk_version` across
`scripts/` returned nothing, so a customer whose upgraded SDK no longer
supported their board revision got a normal, successful emit and firmware
built against the wrong hardware assumptions (alp-sdk issue #1019).

This module is that check, relocated verbatim from alp-sdk's
`scripts/alp_orchestrate/sdk_compat.py`.  It is deliberately pure and
data-only so the comparison can be tested without a board.yaml, a
metadata tree, or a loader.

Also here (alp-sdk issue #1025's SAFE half only): `revision_known()`, the
existence predicate -- given a resolved `hw_revisions:` table, is the
requested hw_rev even a declared key.  A revision absent from the table used
to silently resolve to base-revision routing with a clean exit code; that is
a wrong-hardware emit, not a version mismatch, so it is a distinct check
with a distinct error (`SdkRevisionUnknown`, not `SdkRevisionUnsupported`)
run BEFORE the range comparison below -- an unknown revision has no bounds
to compare against.

Also here: `revision_buildable()`, the maintainer's broad-reading decision
on alp-sdk #1025's other half -- a revision that EXISTS but is
`status: reserved`, `status: tbd`, or carries no `status` key at all is
refused, distinctly from not existing at all (`SdkRevisionNotBuildable`,
not `SdkRevisionUnknown`). `revision_known()` itself stays deliberately
blind to `status:` -- existence and buildability are two different
questions, answered by two different predicates, so a later status change
can't slip into the wrong one silently.

All three of those gates read ONE file per SoM family,
`metadata/e1m_modules/<family>/hw-revisions.yaml`, through
`load_family_table()` below.  That reader used to swallow `OSError` and
`yaml.YAMLError` and answer `{}`, which every predicate here reads as
"nothing to judge" -- so a single tab-indented line in that file disabled
the unknown-revision gate, the not-buildable gate AND the SDK-range gate
at once and emitted a wrong-hardware artefact at exit 0.  It now refuses
instead; see `load_family_table`'s own docstring for why an ABSENT table
is still benign while a present-but-unusable one is not.
