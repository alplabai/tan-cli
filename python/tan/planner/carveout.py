"""Carve-out resolver -- board.yaml `ipc:` entries -> resolved shared-memory regions.

Each IPC entry maps to a `ResolvedCarveOut`: the shared-memory base/size come
from the SoM's resolved memory_map, the region id is a deterministic FNV-1a
hash, plus the default mailbox channel and page alignment. An entry that can't
resolve (missing mailbox metadata / no memory_map) becomes a blocked
ResolvedCarveOut carrying the reason. Extracted from alp_orchestrate as the #285
carve-out seam.

Depends only downward -- models (dataclasses; the metadata root now travels

    Called only once `aperture` has already resolved non-`None` -- the
    caller (`_candidate_regions` below) special-cases `aperture is None`
    itself, honouring the legacy `carveout:` flag verbatim so this whole
    function is a no-op on every non-Alif SoM (V2N/V2M/NX9101).

    Eligible iff the region's derived class (`aperture.classify_region`)
    is not `flash`, AND -- for a region the SoM preset authored itself --
    its `write_authority` is `customer_runtime`. A DERIVED region (SoC-level
    `memory_regions`, or the silicon-variant fallback) needs no authority:
    it is RAM by construction.

    `mram_main` (metadata/e1m_modules/E1M-AEN80{1,...} and its AEN
    siblings) is the reason this function exists: it lists an
    `a32_cluster`/`m55_*` endpoint, carries NO `carveout` key at all, and
    -- while its `base` stays `"TBD"` -- was the only thing standing
    between an `ipc:` entry and a carve-out inside the live ATOC band
    (0x80578000..0x80580000). Its class is `"unresolved"` today (base
    TBD); its authored `write_authority: composite` (not
    `customer_runtime`) already disqualifies it below. Once `base`
    resolves, its extent equals the aperture exactly (the whole-device
    alias) and `classify_region` calls it `"flash"` outright -- the
    hazard is closed on BOTH sides of that resolution.

    AGREE contract (alp-sdk#1365 split B review, BLOCKER): `carveout:` is
    a LEGACY OVERRIDE that must AGREE with a resolvable derived class. It
    is NOT a second vote that can silently win against `flash`/`ram`, nor
    against the `write_authority`-derived answer on an `unclassified`
    row -- a disagreement is a metadata bug, refused loudly, naming BOTH
    the derived class (with the addresses that produced it) and the
    authored flag. Proven regression this closes: a preset-authored row
    OUTSIDE the aperture with `write_authority: customer_runtime` AND
    `carveout: false` used to resolve `status: ok` on the write_authority
    answer alone, silently dropping the author's explicit `carveout:
    false` -- exactly the OSPI-XIP-row shape `classify_region`'s
    `"unclassified"` docstring warns must never become an IPC candidate
    just because it resolves outside the aperture.
