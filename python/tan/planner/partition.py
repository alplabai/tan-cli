"""Storage-partition resolver -- board.yaml `storage:` entries -> resolved partitions.

Resolves each StorageEntry to a ResolvedPartition: picks the flash device (the

with page alignment, and flags overlaps. An entry that can't resolve (unknown
device / no size) becomes a blocked ResolvedPartition. Extracted from

    checking rather than trusting a guessed conversion (alp-sdk#1331).

    Why this is needed at all: `storage[].offset_kib:` (and the bump
    allocator) work in offsets WITHIN a flash device, while `memory_map:`
    regions declare ABSOLUTE bases. Nothing previously bridged the two, so
    every check was blind to the SoM's own layout -- on E1M-AEN801 that let a
    littlefs mount resolve to offset 0 of `mram_main`, which is MCUboot, with
    no `offset_kib:` involved and no `status: blocked`.

    The device base is DERIVED, then VERIFIED, never assumed:

      - If the device is itself a `memory_map:` region with an integer
        `base`, that base is the origin.
      - Otherwise (a whole-window alias like `mram_main`, which declares
        `base: TBD` deliberately) take the lowest integer base among the
        sibling regions and require `lowest + capacity == highest region
        top`. That identity is what proves the alias really spans the same
        window the fine-grained regions tile; if it does not hold, refuse to
        convert.

    `_resolve_flash_device`'s descriptor deliberately carries no physical
    base (Zephyr's flash-mapping layer derives it from the DT controller
    node), which is why the origin is reconstructed here instead of being

    `_resolve_flash_device()` succeeding is NOT enough to recommend a device
    to a customer: its `dt_label` DEFAULTS to the device name whenever the
    metadata omits an explicit override, and that default is unverified
    against the board `.dts` (see the schema's `memory_region.dt_label`
    description -- AEN's `mram_main` region, for example, names its flash
    node `mram_storage`, not `mram_main`). Emitting `&<name>` for one of
    those is the exact defect #1484 closes.

    An `on_module.ospi_memories:` key does NOT qualify, despite its name
    matching a controller node's label 1:1 on paper. Measured against the
    generated Zephyr board trees (#1484 re-review): `ospi0` is the ONLY
    `ospi<n>` label that exists anywhere under `zephyr/`
    (`zephyr/dts/alif/ensemble_e8_peripherals.dtsi:688`), it is included by
    only the two E1M-AEN801 board `.dts` files, and there it is the OSPI
    CONTROLLER node (`compatible = "snps,designware-ospi"`,
    `status = "disabled"`) -- neither AEN801 board tree enables it or gives
    it a flash-chip child, so a `fixed-partitions` overlay under `&ospi0`
    would not be a working flash area even on the one SKU where the label
    exists. E1M-AEN401/601 have a board tree with no `ospi0` node at all;
    E1M-AEN301/501/701 have no board tree in `zephyr/boards/alp/` at all.
    `scripts/gen_zephyr_board.py` never generates an `ospi<n>` node either.
    So until a real per-instance DT label is wired up and verified against
    an ENABLED node, no `ospi_memories:` key is trustworthy here.

    Only trust a `memory_map:` region that carries an EXPLICIT `dt_label:`
    override -- nothing does yet, so this currently returns `False` for
    every device on every SoM. That is the correct interim answer: it means
    `alt_devices` never recommends a target this resolver cannot verify,
    rather than recommending one that merely LOOKS verified.

    alp-sdk#1556: `resolve_storage_partitions()` now gates the PRIMARY
    resolution on this same predicate for a `memory_map:`-sourced device
    (not just the alt-device remedy) -- naming `flash_device: mram_main`
    (or any other unverified `memory_map:` region) can no longer reach
    `status: ok`; it blocks with a reason instead of fabricating a DT
    label the board tree never defines. `on_module.ospi_memories:`
    devices are NOT gated by that change (`is_ospi_device` in the
    resolver still short-circuits this predicate to `True` for them) --
    this function already returns `False` for every `ospi_memories:` key
    (the loop below only ever matches a `memory_map:` region name), so
    gating the primary path on it unconditionally would also block every
    `ospi0`-targeting entry, including the ones the existing storage test
    suite (`tests/scripts/test_orchestrate_storage*.py`) deliberately uses
    as its "device-independent allocator mechanics" fixture. Verifying
    `ospi_memories:` against its own real, per-instance DT label is a
    separate gap this issue's repro does not cover (see this function's
    own paragraph above) -- left as tracked follow-up, not silently

         `offset_kib:` doesn't change sort order — it's an override
         the allocator simply respects).
      3. Place every `offset_kib:`-pinned entry FIRST (page-aligned
         check; overlap check against the SoM's own regions and prior
         pins), then bump-allocate the rest bottom-up from the current
         high-water mark, stepping over the pins.  Pinning first is
         what keeps a pin that sorts LATE alphabetically from being
         dropped by a sibling the allocator had already placed on top
         of it (#554).
      4. Block on capacity overflow, TBD device, page-misaligned
         offset, or sibling overlap.  Blocked entries land in the
         manifest with `status: blocked` + `reason:` so reviewers see
         the gap; the slice build trips when the DTS overlay is
         consumed.

    Spec note: byte-stable OTA images require the orchestrator to pin
    addresses (resolved in design Q1 for v0.6 -- option "Pin in
    orchestrator").  Customers get reproducible per-rebuild addresses
    by declaring stable `name:` slugs; partitions stay at the same
    offset across rebuilds as long as their relative order doesn't
    change.  Explicit `offset_kib:` is the escape hatch.
