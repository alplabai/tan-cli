"""Storage-partition resolver -- board.yaml `storage:` entries -> resolved partitions.

Resolves each StorageEntry to a ResolvedPartition: picks the flash device (the
SoM memory_map region names + on_module.ospi_memories keys), computes base/size
with page alignment, and flags overlaps. An entry that can't resolve (unknown
device / no size) becomes a blocked ResolvedPartition. Extracted from
alp_orchestrate as the #285 partition seam.

Depends only downward -- models (which carries the metadata root the project
was resolved against, tan-cli#573), memregion (_PAGE /

    be computed safely -- the caller then falls back to sibling-only overlap
    checking rather than trusting a guessed conversion (alp-sdk#1331).

    Why this is needed at all: `storage[].offset_kib:` (and the bump
    allocator) work in offsets WITHIN a flash device, while `memory_map:`
    regions declare ABSOLUTE bases. Nothing previously bridged the two, so
    every check was blind to the SoM's own layout -- on E1M-AEN801 that let a
    littlefs mount resolve to offset 0 of `mram_main`, which is MCUboot, with
    no `offset_kib:` involved and no `status: blocked`.

    The device base is DERIVED, then VERIFIED, never assumed:

      - If the device is itself a `memory_map:` region with an integer
        `base`, that base is the origin -- authoritative, no further check
        needed. On every AEN preset today this is the branch `mram_main`
        takes: #2053 resolved its `base` to `0x80000000`, an ordinary
        integer like any other region's.
      - Otherwise (a device with no `base` of its own, e.g. a whole-window
        alias whose `base:` is still an unresolved `"TBD"` placeholder --
        no shipped AEN preset has this shape today; `mram_main` was the
        standing example before #2053) take the lowest integer base among
        the sibling regions and require `lowest + capacity == highest
        region top`. That identity is what proves the alias really spans
        the same window the fine-grained regions tile; if it does not
        hold, refuse to convert. This is the ONLY leg that ever ran the
        identity check -- it exists to substitute for a missing origin,
        so it is unreachable (and its absence is safe, not a gap) once
        the device carries a real `base` and takes the branch above
        instead.

    `_resolve_flash_device`'s descriptor deliberately carries no physical
    base (Zephyr's flash-mapping layer derives it from the DT controller
    node), which is why the origin is reconstructed here instead of being
    read off the descriptor.

    resolved, `write_authority`-bearing, non-overlapping -- CONTIGUOUSLY
    tile that window with no gap (review round 2, Major 1: an earlier
    version of this function summed sizes rather than walking spans, so
    an overlap of N bytes plus a hole of N bytes passed the sum check
    while the hole itself stayed unprotected -- reproduced by deleting
    `atoc` and widening `he_slot0` by exactly `atoc`'s size). Returns a
    refusal reason otherwise, naming the gap or the overlapping pair.

    A row whose resolved extent lies OUTSIDE the window (a genuinely
    unrelated device that merely happens to share this SoM's
    `memory_map:` list) is ignored -- containment, not mere co-listing,
    is what makes a row this alias's business.

    A row whose base or size DOESN'T resolve is not immediately fatal on
    its own (review round 2, Major 3: an earlier version refused for
    ANY such row unconditionally, which also refused a genuinely
    unrelated device parked at a TBD-but-clearly-different address
    purely because its address wasn't resolved yet -- indistinguishable
    from `atoc`'s real pre-HW-mapped shape without more information).
    Instead: walk only the rows that DO resolve; if they alone already
    tile the window with no gap, an unresolved-base sibling can only be
    something else entirely (resolving it into an overlap would be a
    SEPARATE metadata bug for a different gate to catch, not evidence
    this alias is unsafe today) -- but if a gap remains, an unresolved
    sibling is named as a candidate that might explain it (never ruled
    out, per ADR-0034 clause 4), while an alias with NO unresolved
    sibling AND a gap has nothing left to blame but a genuinely missing
    row.

    `origin` is `alias_base` when the alias's own base has resolved;
    else `aperture[0]` when an aperture resolves for this SoM (`mram_main`
    itself carries `base: "TBD"` on every AEN preset today, so this is
    the common case, not the exception -- using the SoC's own declared
    aperture start here, rather than the lowest resolved sibling base,
    avoids anchoring the window at a fabricated address when a resolved
    but genuinely-unrelated sibling happens to sit below every real
    contained row, review round 2 Minor); else the lowest resolved base
    among sibling rows, for a non-Alif SoM with no aperture to anchor to.

    Without this whole function, a sibling with an unresolved `base` or
    a sibling missing from `memory_map:` altogether contributes NO span
    to `_reserved_spans()`, which reserves only what it can see -- so
    the bump allocator treats the unaccounted band as free. On
    `mram_main`, that band can be the Secure-Enclave-owned `atoc` window
    (bench-observed live at 0x80578000..0x80580000, `carveout.py:100-104`).
    `aperture` gates the same absent-write_authority leniency
    `_resolve_flash_device()`'s own guard applies just above this call --
    a non-Alif sibling with no `write_authority` at all is not itself

    """True when `flash_device`'s Devicetree label is KNOWN, not fabricated.

    `_resolve_flash_device()` succeeding is NOT enough to recommend a device
    to a customer: its `dt_label` DEFAULTS to the device name whenever the
    metadata omits an explicit override, and that default is unverified
    against the board `.dts` (see the schema's `memory_region.dt_label`
    description -- AEN's `mram_main` region, for example, names its flash
    node `mram_storage`, not `mram_main`). Emitting `&<name>` for one of
    those is the exact defect #1484 closes.

    An `on_module.ospi_memories:` key does NOT qualify, despite its name
    matching a controller node's label 1:1 on paper. Measured against the
    generated Zephyr board trees (#1484 re-review): `ospi0` is the ONLY
    `ospi<n>` label that exists anywhere under `zephyr/`
    (`zephyr/dts/alif/ensemble_e8_peripherals.dtsi:688`), it is included by
    only the two E1M-AEN801 board `.dts` files, and there it is the OSPI
    CONTROLLER node (`compatible = "snps,designware-ospi"`,
    `status = "disabled"`) -- neither AEN801 board tree enables it or gives
    it a flash-chip child, so a `fixed-partitions` overlay under `&ospi0`
    would not be a working flash area even on the one SKU where the label
    exists. E1M-AEN401/601 have a board tree with no `ospi0` node at all;
    E1M-AEN301/501/701 have no board tree in `zephyr/boards/alp/` at all.
    `scripts/gen_zephyr_board.py` never generates an `ospi<n>` node either.
    So until a real per-instance DT label is wired up and verified against
    an ENABLED node, no `ospi_memories:` key is trustworthy here.

    Only trust a `memory_map:` region that carries an EXPLICIT `dt_label:`
    override -- nothing does yet, so this currently returns `False` for
    every device on every SoM. That is the correct interim answer: it means
    `alt_devices` never recommends a target this resolver cannot verify,
    rather than recommending one that merely LOOKS verified.

    alp-sdk#1556: `resolve_storage_partitions()` now gates the PRIMARY
    resolution on this same predicate for a `memory_map:`-sourced device
    (not just the alt-device remedy) -- naming `flash_device: mram_main`
    (or any other unverified `memory_map:` region) can no longer reach
    `status: ok`; it blocks with a reason instead of fabricating a DT
    label the board tree never defines. `on_module.ospi_memories:`
    devices are NOT gated by that change (`is_ospi_device` in the
    resolver still short-circuits this predicate to `True` for them) --
    this function already returns `False` for every `ospi_memories:` key
    (the loop below only ever matches a `memory_map:` region name), so
    gating the primary path on it unconditionally would also block every
    `ospi0`-targeting entry, including the ones the existing storage test
    suite (`tests/scripts/test_orchestrate_storage*.py`) deliberately uses
    as its "device-independent allocator mechanics" fixture. Verifying
    `ospi_memories:` against its own real, per-instance DT label is a
    separate gap this issue's repro does not cover (see this function's
    own paragraph above) -- left as tracked follow-up, not silently
    widened here.
