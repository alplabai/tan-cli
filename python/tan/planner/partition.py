"""Storage-partition resolver -- board.yaml `storage:` entries -> resolved partitions.

Resolves each StorageEntry to a ResolvedPartition: picks the flash device (the
SoM memory_map region names + on_module.ospi_memories keys), computes base/size
with page alignment, and flags overlaps. An entry that can't resolve (unknown
device / no size) becomes a blocked ResolvedPartition. Extracted from
alp_orchestrate as the #285 partition seam.

Depends only downward -- models (which carries the metadata root the project
was resolved against, tan-cli#573), memregion (_PAGE /
_region_size_bytes), and som_metadata.resolve_memory_map; nothing calls back into
the package __init__.

    be computed safely -- the caller then falls back to sibling-only overlap
    checking rather than trusting a guessed conversion (alp-sdk#1331).

    Why this is needed at all: `storage[].offset_kib:` (and the bump
    allocator) work in offsets WITHIN a flash device, while `memory_map:`
    regions declare ABSOLUTE bases. Nothing previously bridged the two, so
    every check was blind to the SoM's own layout -- on E1M-AEN801 that let a
    littlefs mount resolve to offset 0 of `mram_main`, which is MCUboot, with
    no `offset_kib:` involved and no `status: blocked`.

    The device base is DERIVED, then VERIFIED, never assumed:

      - If the device is itself a `memory_map:` region with an integer
        `base`, that base is the origin.
      - Otherwise (a whole-window alias like `mram_main`, which declares
        `base: TBD` deliberately) take the lowest integer base among the
        sibling regions and require `lowest + capacity == highest region
        top`. That identity is what proves the alias really spans the same
        window the fine-grained regions tile; if it does not hold, refuse to
        convert.

    `_resolve_flash_device`'s descriptor deliberately carries no physical
    base (Zephyr's flash-mapping layer derives it from the DT controller
    node), which is why the origin is reconstructed here instead of being
    read off the descriptor.

         the resolver's failure mode for hand-built projects).
      2. Within each group, sort by name for determinism (an explicit
         `offset_kib:` doesn't change sort order — it's an override
         the allocator simply respects).
      3. Place every `offset_kib:`-pinned entry FIRST (page-aligned
         check; overlap check against the SoM's own regions and prior
         pins), then bump-allocate the rest bottom-up from the current
         high-water mark, stepping over the pins.  Pinning first is
         what keeps a pin that sorts LATE alphabetically from being
         dropped by a sibling the allocator had already placed on top
         of it (#554).
      4. Block on capacity overflow, TBD device, page-misaligned
         offset, or sibling overlap.  Blocked entries land in the
         manifest with `status: blocked` + `reason:` so reviewers see
         the gap; the slice build trips when the DTS overlay is
         consumed.

    Spec note: byte-stable OTA images require the orchestrator to pin
    addresses (resolved in design Q1 for v0.6 -- option "Pin in
    orchestrator").  Customers get reproducible per-rebuild addresses
    by declaring stable `name:` slugs; partitions stay at the same
    offset across rebuilds as long as their relative order doesn't
    change.  Explicit `offset_kib:` is the escape hatch.
