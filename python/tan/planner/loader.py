"""board.yaml loader -- file IO, preset/silicon resolution, and load_board_yaml.

Parses board.yaml into a BoardProject: YAML/JSON IO, schema validation, the
`preset:` shared-board + inline-board resolution, silicon-ref -> SoC JSON path,
per-core topology defaults, and the big `load_board_yaml` entry point (which
finishes by running the cross-field validators). Extracted as the #285 loader
seam.

`load_board_schema` / `iter_schema_errors` are RELOCATED from alp-sdk's
`scripts/alp_cli/validator.py`, the last module-scope import this file made
across the repo boundary. They stay one pair of functions rather than being
inlined into `_validate_board` for the reason alp-sdk gave them their own
names: the schema FILE, the draft dialect, and the error ORDERING are one
decision, so every consumer reports identical violations in identical order.
The schema itself is still read from the bound SDK checkout (`BOARD_SCHEMA`) --
`metadata/**` did not move (ADR-0017).

    Deliberately sourced from the SoM preset's `memory_map:`, NOT from the

    SDK/module build POLICY, not a silicon fact -- two SoMs built on the
    same silicon part can freely choose different slot0 windows (alp-sdk
    #1069, the fix for a stock symmetric layout that put HE's and HP's
    slot0 at the SAME address and let flashing one silently clobber the
    other).

    Reuses `zephyr_board.py`'s own `_aen_role_slot0_map` (lazy import, to
    dodge the circular import -- `zephyr_board.py` imports `_load_yaml`
    from this module at module scope) rather than re-deriving its per-role
    override lookup, so this and board generation read the identical
    override/no-override decision and genuinely cannot disagree on THAT

    one role's `<role>_slot0`, or a wrong `accessible_from`) makes
    `_aen_role_slot0_map` raise `ZephyrBoardEmitError` -- board generation
    refuses to build that core's board file for the same reason, so this
    re-raises as `OrchestratorError` instead of silently publishing an
    address no board was actually built for.

    No-override default: when `_aen_role_slot0_map` finds no per-role
    override, this returns the stock symmetric layout's slot0 window --
    right after the mcuboot region, at the MRAM base -- computed as
    `zephyr_board._AEN_MRAM_BASE + zephyr_board._AEN_MCUBOOT_KIB * 1024`
    directly against those two imported constants, not a locally pinned
    literal, so a change to either constant moves this default too.
    Applies uniformly to EVERY role in the no-override case (not just
    `he`): the stock layout has exactly one slot0 window, and whichever
    M55 core a SoM boots lands on it -- including `m55_hp` on a

    variant that publishes `jlink_flash_device` without also declaring a

    HE/HP MRAM collision in `flash_args` -- flashing one core would corrupt
