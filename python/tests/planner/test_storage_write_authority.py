"""`_resolve_flash_device()` must not place a runtime mount on a
`memory_map` region whose `write_authority` forbids it (alp-sdk#2088),
hand-ported from alp-sdk's
`tests/scripts/test_orchestrate_storage_write_authority.py` (the
`ad9ce6bd` / #2124 re-sync tan-cli#1275 finishes).

Same vocabulary alp-sdk's `check_atoc_reservation._check_top_write_
authority()` (alp-sdk#2086) uses (`customer_runtime` is the only value a
runtime mount/carve-out may land on directly), opposite direction -- that
gate refuses a row that IS `customer_runtime` at the ATOC band; this
refuses a row that is NOT `customer_runtime` (and not a verifiably-safe
`composite` whole-device alias) anywhere it is named directly as a
`flash_device:`.

Two families of case here:

  - `TestRefusesWrongAuthority` / `TestAllowsCustomerRuntime` /
    `TestAbsentWriteAuthority` exercise `_resolve_flash_device()` directly
    against a hand-built, single-region `som_preset` --
    `resolve_memory_map()` returns a preset's own `memory_map:` verbatim
    without touching `metadata_root`, so no real SoM YAML or SoC JSON
    needs to exist on disk for those cases.

  - `TestCompositeConsultsContainedRows` deepcopies the REAL, committed
    E1M-AEN801 preset and swaps only `memory_map:` -- the technique
    alp-sdk#2088 review round 1 required: a single-region synthetic preset
    carries no `silicon:`/SoC data, so `resolve_aperture()` returns
    `None` and the composite-consult path this class exists to pin never
    even runs. `mram_main`'s `write_authority: composite` is the only
    whole-device alias any committed preset declares (every AEN SKU), so
    these cases are the literal #2088 hazard shape, not a contrived one.

Real-SDK-gated: `TestCompositeConsultsContainedRows` needs the real
E1M-AEN801 SoM preset (`metadata/e1m_modules/E1M-AEN801.yaml`) from a
bound alp-sdk checkout -- same requirement as
`test_carveout_aperture_ordering.py`. The other two families are direct
calls needing only SOME bound root to import `tan.planner.partition` at
all (`tan/planner_root.py` raises otherwise).

        SEPARATE, older function with its own weaker origin/window
        derivation -- proving the contained rows individually safe
        (`_composite_alias_coverage_gap()`, pinned above) is not enough,
        because PLACEMENT routes through `_reserved_spans()`, not this
        guard. `mram_main`'s own base was `TBD` on every committed AEN
        preset when this test was originally written upstream;
        alp-sdk#2053 resolved it to `0x80000000`, so the fixture forces
        it back to `TBD` here to keep exercising the identity-derivation
        leg -- see
        `test_reserved_spans_does_not_degrade_when_the_alias_has_its_own_base`
        for the now-real resolved-base shape. With the base unresolved
        and an out-of-window sibling added, `_reserved_spans()`'s
        `window_top = max(hi for sized)` includes that sibling's
        `0x90010000`, failing its `origin + capacity == window_top`
        identity and degrading to `([], reason)` -- silently reserving
        NOTHING, not even `mcuboot` (`write_authority: vendor_image`), for
        whatever placement runs next. Pre-Major-2 this returned
        `status: ok` from `_resolve_flash_device()` because the coverage
        walk alone cannot see `_reserved_spans()`'s own derivation fail."""
