"""A 3000-line module and a 679-line function must not arrive unnoticed
(tan-cli#408).

The house guideline is 800 lines per module and 50 per function. Nothing
enforced either: there is no `[tool.ruff]`, flake8 or pylint section in
`python/pyproject.toml` and no Python lint job in `.github/workflows/`. The
only acknowledgement anywhere under `python/tan/` is one `# noqa: PLR0911,
PLR0912, PLR0915` on `bootstrap_cmd._run`, which no configured linter would
ever act on.

The measurement that makes this a gate rather than a preference: between
tan-cli#408 being filed and this file being written, with nobody objecting
and nothing failing, every one of the six modules it named GREW.

    doctor_cmd.py      3019 -> 3114
    bootstrap_cmd.py   2658 -> 2781
    core/flash_plan.py 1721 -> 1808
    flash_cmd.py       1652 -> 1783
    _run                630 -> 679 lines

So this is a RATCHET, not a cap. It records what is true today and fails on
growth. It deliberately does NOT fail the 23 modules and 199 functions that
are already over -- a gate that is red on the day it lands gets disabled, and
then it guards nothing at all.

## Why a pytest gate and not a ruff job

`python -- pytest across python/` is ALREADY a required context on `main` and
`dev`. A new CI job would have to be added to the required list to matter,
and adding a required context blocks every open PR until it has run on each
of them. This runs inside a gate that is already required, so it starts
enforcing on the next PR with no protection change. `pyproject.toml` gaining
a `[tool.ruff]` section is still worth doing for editor integration; it is
not what makes a rule enforced here.

## How to change these numbers

Lower them, freely, whenever a split lands -- that is the point. Raising one
means a module grew, and needs a reason in the diff that raises it.
