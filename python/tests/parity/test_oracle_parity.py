"""Diff the Python ``tan`` against the shipped Rust ``tan`` on identical inputs.
Any divergence is a port bug -- Rust is authoritative until a capability is
confirmed here, and only then is Rust retired for it.

This is the direct replacement for the ``fan_out`` oracle Phase 4 deleted, so it
has to be honest about two things:

**Scope.** Each case names the surface both binaries genuinely produce; see the
module docstring of ``oracle.py`` for why a naive whole-plan diff is red for a
reason that is not a port bug, and which side was declared correct.

**Coverage.** The port registers ``--version`` and ``build`` today. ``build``
is wired end to end (acquire the plan, substitute, materialise, execute), but
its plan-INSPECTION modes (``--plan``/``--materialise``/``--manifest``) are
not, and no other command exists yet. Cases naming any of those therefore
cannot run end to end. They are marked
``xfail(strict=True)`` and listed by name rather than skipped or softened,
following the precedent in ``tests/conformance/test_contract_envelopes.py``: a
case that starts genuinely passing then reports XPASS and FAILS the run, which
forces the one-line promotion instead of letting a landed command sit
mis-classified as "not ported" forever.
